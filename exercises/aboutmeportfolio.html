        <p>I am a student at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst </a>and my major is Communication Disorders. I am currently getting my certificate in PWTC which is professional writing and in TESOL teaching English abroad.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently a Home Health Aide and Certified Nursing Assistant. I have worked multiple jobs as an HHA, CNA and it is very humbling. I am currently seeking an internship to help me get associated with my future career as a Speech-Language pathologist assistant. </p>
        
        <p>I would like to travel the world one day. I love exploring and learning about other people's cultures. I spend much of my time doing school work. However, I spend much of my free time reading books. </p>
